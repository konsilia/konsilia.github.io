## Current List of Things You Can Do

-   Better mobile support
-   Better and more efficient fuzzy search (should be implemented in [SearchWorker.ts](/src/workers/SearchWorker.ts)). Current implementation is slow and memory consuming.
-   Better unit tests and unit tests for store and components (if possible)
    -   Current unit tests are not robust. Unit tests for Vue components are completely missing
-   More filters and sort options (should be implemented in [ScheduleEvaluator.ts](/src/algorithm/ScheduleEvaluator.ts) and/or [ScheduleGenerator.ts](/src/algorithm/ScheduleGenerator.ts))
-   Support other colleges!
-   Any other amazing things you want to add!
